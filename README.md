# integra-ngo
Integra is a non-governmental organisation which aims to tackle the integration difficulties in the European society and to offer new  integration possibilities. We are a international group of youth citizens. We recognise the complexity and diversity of the world we live in as a fact and as a resource. We consider integration as a need of every human being and as our personal mission. Integration for us means giving to everyone the possibility to be respected and enhanced for its own personal and cultural diversity. To this purpose, we  do not exclude any tool: our activities aim to develop the sensitivity and interest for cultural differences, to raise awareness about the minorities difficulties in the European society, to promote education and formation.
